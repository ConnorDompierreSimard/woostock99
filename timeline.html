                <p>Unruly behavior from those in attendance at the festival was present as early as the second day. Numerous male concertgoers began chanting <span class="text-warning">"show your tits"</span> at actress Rosie Perez as she introduced DMX alongside actor Stephen Baldwin. Annoyed by their chanting, she retorted, <span class="text-warning">"I ain't showing y'all shit!"</span> DMX later performed the song <span class="text-warning">"My N*****"</span> and had the crowd chant along with him; media outlets later reacted to this in confusion and outrage, as the overwhelmingly white audience chanted the word <span class="text-warning">"n****"</span> along with him.</p>

                <p>The <span class="text-warning">"show your tits"</span> chant returned during Sheryl Crow's set, with Crow responding, <span class="text-warning">"You'd have to pay a whole lot more than you paid to get in to see my tits."</span> Crow reported that one audience member had thrown feces at her during her performance of <span class="text-warning">"My Favorite Mistake"</span>. She would later criticize the performance and the festival due to the behavior of the crowd, and stated that she had considered ending her set early out of disgust. She recalled the performance as the <span class="text-warning">"single worst gig I have ever had"</span> in 2019.</p>

                <p>A fan threw a soda bottle at the Offspring singer Dexter Holland during the band's performance of <span class="text-warning">"Have You Ever"</span>, but he continued performing unfazed. Toward the end, before their performance of <span class="text-warning">"Self Esteem"</span>, Holland condemned sexual misconduct in the crowd after witnessing numerous women being groped: <span class="text-warning">"Just because a girl wants to go crowd surfing, it doesn't give the guys the right to molest 'em, you know what I'm saying?"</span>. Holland later told victims of sexual assault in the crowd to confront the perpetrators and <span class="text-warning">"grab [their] fucking balls!"</span></p>

                <p>Halfway in their set, the Offspring lined up five dummies with the faces of each member of the Backstreet Boys in front of their drum riser during a break in between songs. Holland then began hitting the dummies with a plastic baseball bat, and the crowd joined in by throwing water bottles at them. Some commentators have highlighted this incident as part of a pattern of sometimes violent rockist sentiment and machismo expressed by the festival's male performers and attendees, while others felt that it was hypocritical for MTV to promote the festival's heavier rock acts while featuring boy bands such as the Backstreet Boys on its television and radio programming.</p>

                <p>Korn's performance on Friday night considerably riled up the crowd. Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale had reportedly expressed anxiety about performing immediately after Korn due to fears that the crowd's energy could turn violent. This sentiment was shared by Korn's Jonathan Davis, who later admitted that his band's scheduling was mismatched with Bush's and felt he had inadvertently placed Rossdale in a dangerous position. Bush's performance ultimately proceeded without incident and marginally calmed the crowd.</p>

                <p>During the Tragically Hip's performance opening the festival's second day, numerous fans anticipating Kid Rock's performance pelted the band with bottles. Attempting to divert attention from the bottles, frontman Gord Downie began humorously singing "O Canada" in appreciation for the large amount of Canadian fans present waving Canadian flags. Many other fans in the crowd then began booing the band and singing <span class="text-warning">"The Star-Spangled Banner"</span> in response.</p>

                <p>Ryan Miller of Guster recalled performing in front of a hostile crowd displeased with the band's set. Drummer Brian Rosenworcel felt they were unfit for the lineup, as most in attendance were impatiently waiting for nu metal or hip-hop acts such as Limp Bizkit or Ice Cube: <span class="text-warning">"There was this aggressive culture to both the artists that they chose and the audience that they drew, and that is not Guster's bread and butter. ... We were a melodic band and [the others were] Limp Bizkit and Korn and even like DMX [and] I was like, What did we get ourselves into?"</span></p>

                <p>Violence and vandalism would considerably escalate during the evening's performance by Limp Bizkit. Concertgoers also began moshing violently, visibly destroying nearby structures, and crowd-surfing by utilizing the plywood barriers. Frontman Fred Durst addressed the crowd following the song "9 Teen 90 Nine" after being approached by festival staff: <span class="text-warning">"They wanna ask us to ask you to mellow out a little bit. They say too many people are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow out. Mellowing out? That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up."</span> The tension ultimately boiled over during their performance of <span class="text-warning">"Break Stuff"</span>. Durst briefly riled up the audience before the song by asking if they liked NSYNC, earning numerous boos and jeers. During the song's breakdown, Durst addressed the crowd:</p>
                <q class="text-warning">Time to reach deep down inside, and take all that negative energy, all that negative energy, and let that shit out of your fucking system. You got girl problems? You got boy problems? You got parent problems? You got boss problems? You got job problems? You got a problem with me? You got a problem with yourself? It's time to take all that negative energy, and put it the fuck out!</q>

            <div class="bg-dark p-3 w-75">
                <p>Once the breakdown ended, concertgoers immediately began destroying smaller buildings adjacent to the stage and aggressively moshing or punching each other. A large number of attendees also began ripping plywood off the perimeter fence as they attempted to surf on the broken panels; this resulted in several pieces collapsing, dropping crowd surfers onto other fans and possibly crushing them. Terrified of the hostile crowd, several stage technicians assigned to cover the central sound tower placed a sign reading <span class="text-warning">"The Alamo"</span> below the cameras. The technicians were eventually ordered by the grounds crew to evacuate their post. Following the conclusion of the song, the broadcast team muted Durst's microphone while medical staff took in numerous injured concertgoers. Durst addressed the crowd again during a performance of <span class="text-warning">"Nookie"</span>, telling the audience:</p>
                <q class="text-warning">We already let all the negative energy out, it's time to reach down and bring that positive energy to this motherfucker. It's time to let yourself go right now, 'cause there are no motherfuckin' rules out there.</q>

            <div class="bg-dark p-3 w-75">
                <p>Following <span class="text-warning">"Nookie"</span>, Durst walked to the edge of the stage and asked the crowd to assist him as he attempted to crowd-surf on the broken plywood. Security implored Durst not to crowd-surf, but he was undeterred as he asked the crowd to pass him a panel of plywood, on which he later sang <span class="text-warning">"Faith"</span>, closing the band's set. Durst later explained that he had wanted to demonstrate himself enjoying the performance with his audience. Following the set, he was approached by Limp Bizkit manager Peter Katsis and several police officers who informed him that the plywood was ripped off buildings after fans had destroyed multiple structures during his band's performance. John Scher would later vilify Durst for his actions on numerous occasions, noting that numerous staff members had approached Durst between songs, asking him to calm the crowd.</p>

            <div class="bg-dark p-3 w-75">
                <p>Widely blamed for the violence, Durst later stated in an interview, <span class="text-warning">"I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?"</span> Katsis defended Durst in an interview for Netflix 2022 documentary miniseries Trainwreck: Woodstock '99, claiming that <span class="text-warning">"pointing the finger at Fred is about the last thing anybody should do. There really isn't a way to control 300,000 people. The best thing he could do is put on the best show possible, and that's what he did."</span> Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland would also defend Durst, instead blaming the festival's poor conditions. Jonathan Davis was present for Limp Bizkit's performance along with Korn bassist Fieldy; Davis initially condemned Durst's conduct, though he would later opine that Durst's actions were not the primary catalyst for the violence.</p>

                <p>Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor later mocked Durst's actions during the festival in an October 1999 interview with Rolling Stone, telling interviewers that <span class="text-warning">"Fred Durst can surf a piece of plywood up my ass"</span>. Numerous fans reported witnessing further incidents of sexual assault during both Limp Bizkit's and Metallica's performances.</p>

                <p>Due to continually deteriorating conditions, violence and misconduct escalated further throughout the final day. In a 2021 interview, Jewel recalled a feeling of dread during her performance due to the audience's tension and bitterness; she described them as <span class="text-warning">"really tired and very depleted."</span> She, her manager, and the road crew immediately returned to their tour bus and fled the site following her set. Fans had begun regularly throwing bottles at the stage during her set, as well as Creed's earlier in the day. Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose recalled his band being escorted by numerous security guards to the stage for their set as attendees grew increasingly violent following Jewel's performance. Numerous witnesses recalled noticing a growing frequency of fights and property damage across the facility during Godsmack's performance.</p>

                <p>The tension came to a head during the concert's final hours, as Red Hot Chili Peppers performed on the east stage and Megadeth performed on the west stage. One fan shone a laser pointer at Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine in the middle of their performance, prompting him to criticize the crowd's behavior. A group of activists, led by the anti-gun violence organization PAX, had distributed candles to those stopping at their booth during the day, intending them to be lit for a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre during the Chili Peppers' performance of <span class="text-warning">"Under the Bridge"</span>; this had not been mentioned to or approved by local firefighting authorities. The crowd began to light the candles during the Chili Peppers' set, with some using them to start bonfires. Plywood and trash strewn around the site were used to fuel the fires, which had spread to both stages by the end of the Chili Peppers and Megadeth performances. After the Red Hot Chili Peppers finished their main set, the audience was informed about <span class="text-warning">"a bit of a problem"</span>; an audio tower had caught fire. The local fire department was called in to extinguish it, though they refused the call, fearing the audience. Shortly after the tower began burning, a large group of concertgoers climbed the base of its scaffolding, and the tower then collapsed onto the field.</p>

                <p>Rome Mayor Joe Griffo pleaded with the Chili Peppers to return to the stage and calm the crowd in the midst of the chaos. Frontman Anthony Kiedis exclaimed that there was nothing he could do to quell the aggressive crowd as the fires continued to grow. After the band were convinced to return to the stage, Kiedis remarked of the fires, <span class="text-warning">"Holy shit! It's, uh, Apocalypse Now out there."</span></p>

                <p>Multiple media outlets blamed the Red Hot Chili Peppers for inciting the fires after performing a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song <span class="text-warning">"Fire"</span>. Kiedis later wrote in his autobiography, Scar Tissue, that Hendrix's sister had instead asked them to play <span class="text-warning">"Fire"</span> in honor of Hendrix and his performance at the original Woodstock festival. He continued: <span class="text-warning">"It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in."</span></p>

                <p>Prior to the start of the performances that day, rumors arose about a possible unannounced performance following the Red Hot Chili Peppers; Prince, the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Guns N' Roses and Michael Jackson were among the artists thought to be the secret closing act. Scher and Lang continued to hype up the finale to the festival during multiple press conferences earlier in the afternoon. Following the Chili Peppers' performance, the finale was revealed to be a laser show and footage of Jimi Hendrix performing at the original festival in 1969, much to the anger of the attendees; the audience began to boo and attack the vendor booths in large groups.</p>

                <p>Many large, high bonfires were burning before the end of the final performances. Participants danced in circles around the fires. Looking for more fuel, some tore off plywood panels from the supposedly inviolable <span class="text-warning">"Peace Wall"</span> enclosing the festival grounds. ATMs were tipped over and broken into; trailers full of merchandise, food, and equipment were forced open and burglarized; and numerous abandoned vendor booths or tents were turned over and set on fire. Approximately <span class="text-warning">$22,000</span> in total was robbed from ATMs. Frightened festival staff members barricaded themselves inside the control tower, while the few vendors still onsite fled.</p>

                <p>MTV was hired to cover the festival extensively; however, as the environment deteriorated, attendees grew increasingly hostile towards anchors and MTV's staff. Carson Daly recalls being pelted by bottles, rocks, and batteries frequently while he was covering the festival, noting that executives from MTV issued a statement to their staff on site that the network's parent firm Viacom could no longer guarantee their safety. The network ultimately evacuated its entire crew amidst the violence on Sunday night. Longtime anchor Kurt Loder likened the experience to covering news in a war zone, particularly during the final night as concertgoers began violently attacking the news trucks and reporters:</p>
                <q class="text-warning">It was dangerous to be around. The whole scene was scary. There were just waves of hatred bouncing around the place ... It was clear we had to get out of there ... It was like a concentration camp. To get in, you get frisked to make sure you're not bringing in any water or food that would prevent you from buying from their outrageously priced booths. You wallow around in garbage and human waste. There was a palpable mood of anger.</q>

A large force of <span class="text-warning">500 to 700</span> New York State Police troopers, local police officers, <span class="text-warning">25</span> firefighters, and various other law enforcement arrived. Most had riot control gear and proceeded to form a riot line that flushed the crowd to the northwest, away from the stage located at the eastern end of the airfield. Some reports state that numerous members of the crowd offered strong resistance, and they dispersed back toward the campground and out the main entrance. Others claim that the riot line allowed the concertgoers to <span class="text-warning">"tire themselves out"</span> in the campground area and that the fires were not contained until <span class="text-warning">"well after sunrise"</span>. A report by SonicNet in 1999 estimated that it took law enforcement five hours to stop the riot.</p>
